       "\"One curious fact about Roman Abramovich is that he has a unique and somewhat mysterious past. Before becoming a successful businessman and owner of Chelsea Football Club, Abramovich was a street trader in Moscow, selling anything from plastic ducks to rubber toys. However, what's even more fascinating is that he also has a background in the oil industry, and his rapid accumulation of wealth in the 1990s has been shrouded in controversy and speculation. It's been reported that he was able to acquire significant stakes in several large Russian oil companies, including Sibneft, through a series of complex and somewhat opaque deals. This led to him becoming one of the wealthiest men in Russia, with an estimated net worth of over $15 billion. Despite his immense wealth, Abramovich remains an enigmatic figure, and his rise to success is still not fully understood.\""
